# workstash
Collection of documents ranging from notes to assignments, hosted here with the intent of improving the studying experience of students at Louisiana Tech.

If you would like to contribute your own work to the repository, email me the contents in a zip/rar archive at

latechstudybuddy@gmail.com

and make sure to let me know which class and professor these documents relate to.

It is not recommended to turn in any of the assignments posted here as your own work. This repo is designed to be a study assistant. Use the information to your own wim at your own risk.

All files on this repo are property of the university and will be taken down upon request.
